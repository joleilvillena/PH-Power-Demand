# Forecasting the Power Demand of the Luzon Electrical Grid using Clustering and Predictive Modeling

In the World Economic Forumâ€™s [Global Competitiveness Index in 2019](http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_TheGlobalCompetitivenessReport2019.pdf), the Philippines ranked low in electricity access (103) and electricity supply quality (53) out of 141 countries. Prediction of electricity consumption will contribute a critical metric to improve the economy. With accurate forecasting, it would allow policymakers to create laws for developing electricity infrastructure and planning supply. With this in mind, the project aims to create an initial, proof-of-concept forecasting model of the power generation demand in Luzon.
